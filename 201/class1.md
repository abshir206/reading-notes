### Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

- The browser sends HTTP request to the server the same way i send food requests at resturants.


### Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

- As the browser parses the HTML, it sends requests back to the server for any CSS files it has found from < link> elements, and any JavaScript files it has found from < script> elements, and from those, then parses the CSS and JavaScript.


### How can you find images to add to a Website?

- When you find the image you want, click on the image to get an enlarged view of it.

- Right-click the image (Ctrl + click on a Mac), choose Save Image As…, and choose a safe place to save your image. Alternatively, copy the image's web address from your browser's address bar for later use.


### How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?

-String have quotes around them, numbers dont.

### What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

- Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable. Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change an image displayed in an image gallery.

### What is an HTML attribute?

- Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.

### Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.

- The anatomy of our element is:

The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.
The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.

### What is the Difference between < article> and < section> element tags?

- < article> encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page (e.g., a single blog post).
<section> is similar to < article>, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines and summaries), or a theme.

### What Elements does a “typical” website include?

- header: <header>.
- navigation bar: <nav>.
- main content: <main>, with various content subsections represented by <article>, <section>, and <div> elements.
- sidebar: <aside>; often placed inside < main>.
- footer: <footer>.

### How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?

- The description is also used on search engine result pages.

### How is the <meta> HTML tag used when specifying metadata?

- Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a document — the < meta> element.
